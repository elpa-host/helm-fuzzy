# helm-fuzzy
> Fuzzy matching for helm source.

[![CI](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/helm-fuzzy/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/helm-fuzzy/actions/workflows/test.yml)

## Featuers

* Work with all `helm` source.
* Decouple from `helm-source`.
* Uses [flx](https://github.com/lewang/flx).

## Differences from other alternatives

* [helm-flx](https://github.com/PythonNut/helm-flx)
  * Doesn't work for sources that don't already support fuzzy matching
* [helm-fuzzier](https://github.com/EphramPerdition/helm-fuzzier)
  * Only enhance matching for sources that have fuzzy-matching enabled
* [helm-fuz](https://github.com/cireu/fuz.el)
  * Uses [fuz.el](https://github.com/cireu/fuz.el).

## Usage

To enable this by putting these line of codes to your configuration.
```el
(require 'helm-fuzzy)
(with-eval-after-load 'helm
  (helm-fuzzy-mode 1))
  ```

If you use `use-package`, you can put these line of codes instead.
```el
(use-package helm-fuzzy
  :init
  (with-eval-after-load 'helm
    (helm-fuzzy-mode 1)))
```

### Inhibit fuzzy matching

You might don't want to fuzzy match some of the action. You can customize 
`helm-fuzzy-not-allow-fuzzy` variable adding or removing the helm 
buffer name.

```el
(setq helm-fuzzy-not-allow-fuzzy '("*helm-ag*"))
```
